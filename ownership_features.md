All right, so I just want your help kind of thinking about things. I'm going to be, I'm transcribing my voice right now, so I will stop periodically. I may even stop mid-sentence, but, you know, I don't want to, like, talk too long, and then the transcription service just fails, and I lose everything. So that's why I'm going to stop periodically, even mid-sentence or mid-thought, and that's why, if you see that, you know. So you're just taking in context, gathering a whole picture, and then we'll brainstorm together. So basically, I'm the vice president of revenue operations at a software company called Opus. We sell electronic health record software in the behavioral health space, and I head up the head of sales, right? I was a superstar salesperson, and then they promoted me to run the whole revenue engine and kind of manage the account executives now, as opposed to doing, like, sales myself. So I take that very seriously, and what I'm doing is I'm basically building an application that is going to sit on top of the HubSpot CRM that we use and function as my, like, I don't know, mission control center, right? So what I've done is the account executives that we have, like, basically, I'm creating, like,


I’m tracking.
I’ve got the context so far and I’m following your train of thought. Go ahead and keep going whenever you’re ready.


All right, so yeah, I got cut off there because of a phone call, so I'm continuing here. Yeah, I'm building an application that sits on top of HubSpot. It's like a mission control, right? So it's going to be AI, and it's already built. I already have, like, a working agent associated with the application. It doesn't work through the front end right now, but it's, like, there on the back end to be connected. And then I have the front end, which you kind of see in the images. You can kind of see what I have already. And yeah, I'm, like, building this thing out, right? Now, I want you, like, I want to think from the perspective of my superiors. The chief executive officer, his name is Humberto. Then the chief marketing officer, his name is Eric. And then the owner, his name is Robert, right? So think from their perspectives, like, what would they want to see, right? Like, you know, like, with what I'm building, right, I have the opportunity to, like, create dashboards and have the opportunity to send automated reports on a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly basis. I have the ability to surface information about the account executives, how they're performing, how we're measuring against our goals, our trends, so on and so forth, right? And as I'm building out this application, I also want to keep in mind, like, who I'm reporting to. And I want you to help me think about what are the things I can automate, create via dashboards, use AI for, create reports, manage things with my position that when I send these artifacts their way, either through email or whether I schedule calls and in-office sessions where I present numbers, like, what is it that I have to be producing that is valuable to them and shows them my value in my role and, you know, wows them and excites them and, you know, really shows them that I know what I'm doing. Like, I'm trying to get you to help me figure out what that is, okay? So I think you can take and run with that now.


Perfect, this is a great place to pause and zoom out. I’ll take this in the spirit you intend: not feature brainstorming yet, but **executive-level value design**. I’ll frame this from *their* vantage point, then translate it into what your “mission control” should reliably produce.

I’ll break this into five parts:

1. **How Humberto (CEO), Eric (CMO), and Robert (Owner) actually think**
2. **The core questions each of them wants answered without asking**
3. **What artifacts make you look indispensable (dashboards, reports, narratives)**
4. **Where AI specifically creates leverage (not gimmicks)**
5. **What “wow” looks like at the exec level**

---

## 1. Executive Mental Models (This Matters More Than UI)

### Humberto – CEO

He is thinking in systems, not deals.

His internal loop is:

* “Are we on pace?”
* “If we miss, will I know *early*?”
* “Where is execution breaking?”
* “Do I trust the person running revenue?”

He doesn’t want activity.
He wants **predictability, early warning, and confidence**.

---

### Eric – CMO

He is thinking in cause and effect.

His loop:

* “Is marketing doing its job?”
* “Are sales reps converting what we give them?”
* “Where is the funnel leaking?”
* “Do we need more volume or better execution?”

He wants **clean attribution and conversion clarity**.

---

### Robert – Owner

He is thinking in risk and trajectory.

His loop:

* “Is this business under control?”
* “Is growth repeatable?”
* “Do we have adults in the room?”
* “If I step away, does this still work?”

He wants **governance, trend lines, and confidence in leadership**.

## 2. The Questions They Want Answered Automatically

If your system answers these *without them asking*, you win.

### CEO Questions (Weekly / Monthly)

* Are we ahead, on pace, or behind right now?
* If we’re behind, **why specifically**?
* Which reps are carrying risk this quarter?
* Is this a volume problem or an execution problem?
* What needs my intervention?

### CMO Questions

* Which sources create pipeline that actually closes?
* Are reps following up fast enough on marketing leads?
* Where does marketing handoff break down?
* Do we need more leads or better sales behavior?

### Owner Questions

* Is performance improving or deteriorating over time?
* Is leadership proactive or reactive?
* Do forecasts become more accurate each quarter?
* Is revenue dependent on heroes or systems?

---

## 3. The Artifacts That Prove Your Value

Think less “dashboard” and more **executive artifacts**.

### A. Weekly Revenue Pulse (Email or PDF)

This should feel inevitable, not optional.

**1 page. No fluff.**

* QTD target vs actual vs pace
* Pipeline coverage ratio
* Stage-by-stage conversion vs benchmark
* Reps at risk (with reason)
* One paragraph narrative: *“Here’s what changed this week and why”*

This alone is a VP-level deliverable.

---

### B. Monthly Revenue Review Deck (Auto-Generated)

Not slides full of numbers. Slides that tell a story.

Sections:

1. Where we started vs where we are
2. What worked this month
3. What broke this month
4. Leading indicators for next month
5. Risks and mitigation plan

If this is auto-assembled from your app, that’s power.

---

### C. AE Performance Scorecards (Private)

This is internal leverage, not exec fluff.

For each rep:

* Activity → conversion → pipeline → forecast accuracy
* Stage aging
* Follow-up SLA adherence
* Trend vs last quarter

This lets you coach *with receipts*.

---

### D. Forecast Confidence Index (This Is a Big One)

Executives don’t trust forecasts by default.

You can earn trust by showing:

* Historical forecast vs actual accuracy
* % of forecast coming from late-stage deals
* Deal slippage patterns
* Risk-adjusted forecast vs raw forecast

That’s advanced RevOps maturity.

---

## 4. Where AI Actually Adds Value (Not Hype)

Here’s where your agent shines *if used correctly*.

### 1. Executive Summaries

AI should answer:

> “What changed, why it changed, and what we’re doing about it.”

This saves you hours and makes you look sharp.

---

### 2. Risk Detection

AI flags:

* Deals stalled beyond normal cycle
* Reps missing key behaviors
* Pipeline inflation
* Stage skipping
* End-of-quarter heroics

This shows **control**.

---

### 3. Rep Coaching Prompts

Instead of:
“Chris is behind.”

You get:
“Chris is behind because demos are converting 40% below benchmark and follow-up latency is 2.3x team average.”

That’s actionable leadership.

---

### 4. Marketing Feedback Loop

AI can auto-summarize:

* Which lead sources close
* Which ones stall
* Why sales is losing deals sourced by marketing

That strengthens your relationship with Eric instantly.

---

## 5. What “Wow” Actually Looks Like to Them

This is subtle but important.

**Wow is not flashy UI.**
**Wow is calm certainty.**

They should feel:

* “We always know where we stand.”
* “Problems surface early.”
* “Revenue is being actively managed, not hoped for.”
* “Adi is thinking ahead of us.”

The moment they stop asking:

> “How are we tracking?”

and start saying:

> “Let’s look at the RevOps report…”

—you’ve won.

---

## One Final Reframe (Important)

You are not building:

> “A dashboard on top of HubSpot.”

You are building:

> **A revenue nervous system.**

Your job is not to show data.
Your job is to **turn uncertainty into clarity**.

Next step, when you’re ready:

* We can define **the exact dashboards**
* Or design **the weekly exec email**
* Or map **AI agents to specific decisions**
* Or pressure-test what you’ve already built

Just tell me where you want to go next.
