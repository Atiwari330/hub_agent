# 1/3/2026 - Dashboard Planning

## prommpt
Alright, so you can take a look at what the application is. This is a personal, one-user-only application for the Vice President of Revenue Operations at Opus EHR software company. I function as the Head of Sales. I'm creating this application, which is essentially a large language model agent, layered on top of the HubSpot CRM. HubSpot CRM is essentially the source of truth for my account executives, and I aim to make this my mission control center for my entire job.

To do my job most effectively, particularly as it concerns two deals: their health and how to optimize the company for being able to close as many deals as possible. You can see what I've built, a ready the dashboard, there's an agent under the hood that hasn't been connected. You can investigate all that.

My ask of you is if I told you now that I wanted to create a dashboard for myself, right? And you can see the three account executives and myself. I also run deals, but I'm analyzing and supervising in managing the three sales executives, UC there are most Christopher and Jack. Now imagine I told you I wanted a dashboard. Imagine I told you I don't know because I don't have all the power and wisdom of how the greatest Chief Revenue Officers, Head of Sales have done it for software, SaaS companies.

But I want to create a dashboard that gives me the most actionable insights. When I log in, I want to be able to see from my perspective what do I need to do? What information do I need to know? What insight do I need to have to be able to pull levers to course correct? Whether that be leads haven't been where they need to be, whether you know there are certain account executives who have you and there may be varying layers to this.

To answer this question, you must say, "Well, are you looking at a forecast? Are you looking to do different things?" I'm thinking number one from the day-to-day, but I do think though there's probably supposed to be another dashboard where I'm able to see like forecast numbers or more high-level type statistics that I would look at for over a time span of weeks and months vs the more day-to-day sort of dashboard.

Even a more yearly macro and even forecasting macro right or insight. So when if you think of this dashboard, you actually have to think of it as a multi-time vector set of dashboards and each with their own benefits. The dashboards summarize and surface important data across all of the account executives. If I want to get specific about an Account Executive, I can go to their profile and look at their numbers specifically, but on the dashboard, I expect that everything that is functioning has shouldn't be in my attention, but things that are from a day-to-day standpoint not functioning well, maybe down to the deal level. I know about those things, right?

And then you can apply the same thought process for weekly, monthly, and different time scales. Even thinking about forecasting and then even thinking from the perspective of leads as a whole, like the lead the top of funnel, if you will. The Account Executives were really looking at how they're handling leads that they've been given or are working on.

There also probably should be some aspect of this where there's a dashboard related to the top of funnel and maybe you know new workings, new leads haven't been where they need to be, and even that would have to be broken down by lead channel or lead source, if you will.

So right now, your task is to get a grasp of the whole application, make you understand what has been built. Take my ramble there, all that information that I just gave you, and then I want you to lay out a plan for me in as much detail as you possibly can. Maybe you need to write this to a plan.md file to really do it comprehensively.

What are the dashboards you recommend? I want you to really think like the best Chief Revenue Officer of all time in software, SaaS sales, and get really specific about what dashboards you envision across each time scale. The dashboards setup, do you think there should be multiple dashboards? Is it one long continuous one? Is it one with the drop-down select or whatever you think is the most efficient?

What are the different metrics and insights and things, and how do you see them laid out across the shorter time scale, the longer time scales, the intermediaries, the longer term, the pre, and the post? Give me you know, take this and really run with it.
